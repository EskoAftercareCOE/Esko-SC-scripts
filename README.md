====== 
## A few userscripts  to workaround ServiceCloud's annoyances in Esko's support environment ##

These scripts will be useful for anyone at esko being annoyed by ServiceCloud's limitations (_at least that's the hope_).

The scripts are what is called "userscripts". This is a specfic type of JavaScript, meant to be exectuted via a browser extension and that can interact with and/or modify web pages.
